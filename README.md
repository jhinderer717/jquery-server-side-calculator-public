# Server Side Calculator

## Description

This project takes two numbers input by the user and an operation and does the calculation in the server. The answer is displayed below the input fields.

Entering less than two numbers, a non number, or not entering an operator gives a message in the console and does no calculation.

There is a clear button which clears both fields and the operation to be done.

The history is kept in the server and is displayed everytime the equal button is hit.
